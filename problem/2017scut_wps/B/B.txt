Homework of Physics

Physics teacher gives Nobita three crystal balls, and asks Nobita to finish a homework.
There are a building of N floors,
Nobita should use these three crystal balls to get the critical value of crystal ball to be breaked.
That is find the number K, the crystal ball will not be breaked if it's thrown in the Kth floor,
but the crystal ball will be breaked if it's thrown in the (K+1)th floor.
So Nobita need to find a policy to do experiment to get the value K,
and make the number of tries in the worst situation to be minimum.

Note: If the crystal ball is breaked, it can't be used again.
Note: The crystal may be breaked in the first floor, or not be breaked in the Nth floor.

Input

The first line contains an integer T, indicates the number of test case.
For each test case,
Contain a integer N, indicates the number of floors in this building.
(1<=N<=10^15)

Output

For each test case, output one line.
Contain an integer means the critical value K.
