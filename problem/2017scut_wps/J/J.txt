Homework of English

The English teacher give Nobita a very very strange homework.
And Nobita am really doesn't konw why teacher gives him such a homwork.
Perhaps that's because of Nobita's English is very bad.
The homework is like this.
There are a integer sequence a[1],a[2],...,a[N] of length N, and two integer P and M.
And then there are Q queries.
Each query contains two integers L and R.
Nobita need to konw the value (a[L]*(P^0)+a[L+1]*(P^1)+a[L+2]*(P^2)+...+a[R]*(P^(R-L)))%M for each query.

And for any two queries L1,R1 and L2,R2,
if L1<L2 then R1<L2 or R1>=R2.

Input

There are lots of test case.
For each test case.
The first line contains integers N,P,M.
The second line contains integers a[0],b,c,d
And the sequence a will be got through this four numbers, that is a[i]=(a[i-1]*b+c)%d for 1<=i<=N.
The Third line contains a integer Q.
The next Q lines each line contain two integers L and R.

(1<=N<=5000000, 2<=P,M<=10^9, 1<=Q<=10^5, 1<=L<=R<=N, 1<=a[0],b,c,d<=10^9)

Output

For each query output one line.
Contain a integer indicates the answer.
