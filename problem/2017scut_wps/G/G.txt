And now they want to get out of this tower.

This tower contains N floors, they are both in the first floor at first.
Each day, the person who stays in the lower floor will be chosed (if both of them are in the same floor, chose a random person of them).
And the person be chosed will fight with a monster, if this person win, he will go to the upper one floor.

If one of them get to the Nth floor, this one person will get out of the tower.
So now they want to know the expection value of days that both of them will get out of the tower.
