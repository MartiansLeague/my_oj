Homework of Algorithm

After the Algorithm class, the teacher gives Nobita a very very difficult homework.
There are a complete graph of n nodes, the node is numbered through 1 to n,
and the length of all edges is 1. And at first the color of all edges is black.
The teacher gives m operations, each operation will color an edge to red.
After the m operations,
Nobita needs to know the number of routes that go through each node of this n node exactly once.
And go througe at least one red edge.

Besides, with the help of Doraemon, Nobita knows some things about teacher's operation.
1. There aren't two different operations color the same edge.
2. For each node, there are at most 2 red edges connect this node.
3. The red edge will not form a circle.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m.
The next m lines, each line contains two integers u and v, indicate that color the edge between u and v.
(2<=n<=2000, 1<=m<n, 1<=u,v<=n)

Output

Output the answer % 1000000007.
