Homework of Geography

The Geography teacher likes chess very much,
Because he thinks that the chessboard is the same as the Geography map.
So he gives Nobita a homework about chessboard.

There are a chessboard of N*M size,
Number the rows 1-N from top to bottom, number the columns 1-M from left to right.
There are Q cells contains an obstacle.

Nobita want to cover all empty cells use 1*2 or 2*1 blocks,
blocks can't cover other blocks, and can't cover the place out of chessboard, and can't cover a cell contains obstacle.
And if the blocks cover the edge of two cells, Nobita will get a value.

Now Nobita want to konw the minimum sum of values he gets after cover all empty cells.

Input

There are lots of test case.
For each test case.
The first line contains two integers N and M.
The second line contains a integer Q.
The next Q lines, each line contain two integers x and y, indicate the cell in xth row and yth column contains a obstacle.
The next N lines, for each line contains M-1 integers val.
the ith line, jth number, indicate the value Nobita will get if he cover the cell (i,j) and (i,j+1).
The next N-1 lines, for each line contains M integers val.
the ith line, jth number, indicate the value Nobita will get if he cover the cell (i,j) and (i+1,j).
(2<=N<=30, 2<=M<=30, 1<=Q<N*M, 1<=val<=10^6)

Output

For each test case output one line.
Contain a number indicates the minimum sum of values,
if Nobita can't cover all empty cells, output "-1"(without quotes).
